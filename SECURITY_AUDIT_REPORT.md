```javascript
// Code verified in api/api/lots/index.js
if (!user.fica_approved) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'FICA approval required to bid' });
}
if (user.suspended) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Account suspended' });
}
```

**Restriction Matrix:**
- ❌ `unverified` users: Cannot bid
- ❌ `submitted` users: Cannot bid  
- ✅ `approved` users: Can bid
- ❌ `rejected` users: Cannot bid
- ❌ `suspended` users: Cannot bid/login

### 4. ✅ ADMIN CONTROLS

**Admin Functionality Verified:**
- ✅ User approval/rejection system
- ✅ User suspension with immediate effect
- ✅ FICA document review and approval
- ✅ Admin role-based access control
- ✅ Audit logging for admin actions
- ✅ Admin-only access to seller submissions

### 5. ✅ SELLER ITEM SUBMISSIONS

**Privacy Implementation Confirmed:**
- ✅ Items submitted by sellers are admin-only visible
- ✅ Public users cannot access submitted items
- ✅ Secure image storage for submissions
- ✅ Admin approval workflow for items

### 6. ✅ INVOICE SYSTEM

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Buyer invoice generation system exists
- ✅ Seller payout statement system exists  
- ✅ User access control (users see only their invoices)
- ✅ Admin can view all invoices
- ✅ PDF generation capability
- ✅ Sequential invoice numbering

### 7. ✅ EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS

**SMTP Configuration Verified:**
- ✅ Gmail SMTP configured and tested
- ✅ Email templates for all workflows
- ✅ Welcome, verification, approval/rejection emails
- ✅ Bid confirmations and outbid notifications
- ✅ Invoice delivery emails

---

## 🔐 SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### Authentication & Authorization ✅
- JWT-based authentication with secure secret (needs rotation)
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Session management with token expiration
- Password reset functionality with time-limited tokens

### Input Validation ✅
- File upload validation (type, size limits)
- Request body validation
- SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection via CSP headers

### Data Protection ✅
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- FICA documents stored privately
- Signed URLs for document access
- Database encryption in transit (SSL)

---

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STATUS

### Database Performance ✅
- ✅ Connection pool: 100 connections
- ✅ Critical indexes implemented
- ✅ N+1 query problems eliminated
- ✅ Optimized auction queries

### Caching Strategy ✅
- ✅ Redis caching implemented
- ✅ Smart cache TTL (30-60 seconds)
- ✅ Cache invalidation on data changes
- ✅ Fallback to in-memory cache

### Frontend Performance ✅
- ✅ React optimization (memo, useMemo)
- ✅ localStorage access optimized
- ✅ Render loop performance fixed

---

## 🔍 CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS

### Security Best Practices ✅
```javascript
// Proper input validation
if (!user.fica_approved) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'FICA approval required' });
}

// Secure file handling
const allowedTypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|gif|webp/;
if (!allowedTypes.test(file.mimetype)) {
  return cb(new Error('Only image files allowed'));
}

// SQL injection prevention
await dbManager.query(
  'UPDATE users SET suspended = $2 WHERE email = $1', 
  [email, suspended]
);
```
